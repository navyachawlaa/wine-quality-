The objective of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model capable of assessing the quality of wines based on various input features.
By leveraging a dataset containing information about different wine attributes and their respective quality rating
This Project aims to create a robust model that can accurately predict wine quality.
This abstract presents two datasets containing information on red and white vinho verde wine samples from the north of Portugal. 
The datasets comprise physicochemical test results along with quality ratings for the wines. The primary objective is to develop predictive models that can estimate wine quality based on these physicochemical attributes.
Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze the datasets and create models for quality prediction.
Various techniques, such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, are utilized to build accurate and robust models.
Additionally, feature selection methods and data preprocessing techniques are applied to optimize model performance. The findings from this analysis demonstrate the potential of machine learning in predicting wine quality based on physicochemical characteristics. 
These models can assist winemakers in assessing and enhancing the quality of their wines, potentially leading to process improvements and better product outcomes. 
This report presents a machine learning project aimed at predicting wine quality based on various features and attributes. Classification and regression algorithms were employed to analyze a dataset containing information about different wines.
The objective was to develop accurate models that could classify wine quality and predict numerical ratings. The results showed promising performance, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in wine quality assessment.
